{ "prompt": "Redink short intro", "completion": "It’s one thing to automate the classrooms. To actually automate the entire grading system digitally is altogether a different conversation.

A simple tool allows seamless communication between teachers, parents, students, and other stakeholders.  Digitized grade-book has become ever more important than before for two reasons.
